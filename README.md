# Pacman with AI (C++ and Allegro5)

This project is an implementation of the classic Pacman game with an AI-controlled Pacman using C++ and the Allegro5 library. The AI employs various algorithms and heuristics to navigate the maze, hunt for pellets, and avoid ghosts.

## Features

- Classic Pacman gameplay with maze, pellets, and ghosts
- AI-controlled Pacman with intelligent pathfinding and decision-making
- Configurable game settings (e.g., maze layout, ghost behavior)
- Score tracking and high score leaderboard
- Smooth graphics and animations powered by Allegro5
